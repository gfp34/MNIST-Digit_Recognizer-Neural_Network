# MNIST-Digit_Recognizer-Neural_Network
Simple Neural Network for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST Database


This code creates and trains a Neural Network to read handwritten digits. The network was created from scratch using the NumPy library for vector
and matrix operations, and the [MNIST Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) of handwritten digits for training data.

Running this usually yields about 94%-95% accuracy. 

This [youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk) on neural networks created by 3Blue1Brown was used as a guide for this project, along with
the free online book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by Michael Nielsen.
